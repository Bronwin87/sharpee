Assumptions:
A game object is stored in the world model as a node.
A game room/location is stored in the world model as a node.
A game object can be a container, which would allow other objects to be contained by it.
A game object can be a supporter, which would allow other objects to be located "on top" of it.
A game object with container capabilities is defined by its node properties.
A game object with supporter capabilities is defined by its node properties.
A game object can have a node property of scenery, which cannot be moved or taken.
A game object can have a node property of moveable.
A game object can have a node property of takeable.

A game object can be a character.

A character object can exist without a location or usage (node without edges).
A character object can be the player character (only one is allowed).
A character object can be a non-playing character (unlimited number).

The player character can be set from any existing character.
