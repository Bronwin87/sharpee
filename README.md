# Sharpee - A parser-based IF platform in C#/.NET Core

I started working on this project a few years ago as a learning exercise. I wanted to understand all of the moving parts of a parser-based IF platform. This led to iteratively building parsers, world models, standard libraries, grammar definitions, turn loops, and event handlers.

When ChatGPT-4 was released, I started to take it slightly more seriously, but still slowly because there were limitations of my time, ChatGPT-4's capabilities and prompt-limites (original you got 25 prompts before being put on timeout).

A few months ago, Anthropic released Claude Opus 3, a competitor to ChatGPT4. I tested it out and switched my paid subscription immediately.

I have since been seriously honing in on design decisions and completing portions of the platform.

I plan to discuss this on a Ghost blog, which I will identify once I get a sub-domain setup.

I also talk in a limited fashion on intfiction.org. It's no secret that the IF community is a herd of cats, especially when it comes to people building new systems. There's very little patience.

## Design Choices

### World Model
The world model has its first version completed. It's built on an in-memory bidirectional graph data structure with a pub/sub state change event handler built in. Unit tests have it functioning as expected (for now).

### Standard Library
In an IF Platform, there is a translation from general programming to "IF" concepts. This class library is where that magic happens.

#### Map
A Fluent class that implements IF Rooms, Doors, Containers, and Supporters. It's intended to separate map building from storytelling.

#### Story
A Fluent class that implements things, the PC (player character), NPCs (Non-Playing Characters), the meta data for the story, the prologue, and of course, the turn loop.

### Grammar Library
A fluent class that defines accepted input sentence structures.

### Text Service
A simple service that allows the story and author to emit text with context.

#### Open design discussion
##### Push or Pull model?
I'm starting with a push model where the game emits all text with context to the service.

It's possible this could be flipped and the Text Service simply interrogates the Story for changes and current state to form output to the user.

### Language Library (english as the default)
The Language library is a set of known constants that allow the platform to understand input and emit automated portions of text properly. It's values are used throughout the Standard Library and in the Grammar Library.

#### Open design discussion
##### Naming conventions
The naming convention may change to lang-en-US.cs to signify which language file to use when compiling a story.
